- 👋 Hi, I’m @MaNaReal
- 👀 I’m interested in learning about medium-high level python to start developing personal projects, and also web-dev related languages;
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and SQL by myself, and C# at school;
- 💞️ I’m looking to learn from people older and more expert than me in programming in general to start my career, in a future not too far;
